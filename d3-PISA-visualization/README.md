This is a rather simple project for visualizing data on PISA tests, and connecting them to milestones that have happened during the 21st century.
To run the program, It is assumed that D3 is added to the directory.
The run program  depicts a line-race graph that responds to user input (pressing the space button). The visuals could use some fine tuning, but all-in-all the program runs quite well.
