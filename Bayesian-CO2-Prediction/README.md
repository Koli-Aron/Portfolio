This was a project for predicting the CO2 emissions of a given country using a hierearchical beta model. The dataset originally had over 50 initial variables, but was skimmed down to the 16 most relevant. The resulting model was highly accurate, as is indicated by the resulting plots in the images folder.
Although unintentional, the paper ended up supporting and making use of the Environmental Kuznets Curve (https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/environmental-kuznets-curve) hypothesis, showcasing the logarithmic relationship between CO2 emissions and GDP-per-capita.
